## About Myself üëã

My name is Musa Demir.

I graduated from the Computer Engineering department at Sakarya University.

Currently, I work at [Migros Ticaret A.≈û.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/migros-ticaret) as a Senior Full-Stack Developer.

Prior to this, I worked at Games United as a Senior Full Stack .Net Developer for over 1.5 years. In this role, I handled server-side requirements, web APIs, and implemented game logics for a multiplayer casual mobile games.

Simultaneously, I managed my own company, where we developed games, growing the team to 8 members and overseeing the team's management.

Before joining Games United, I worked at Volosoft for over 3.5 years. As one of the main developers for [AspNet Boilerplate](https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate), [AspNet Zero](https://aspnetzero.com/), their sub-projects, and internal projects, I contributed to the development of web frameworks. During this time, I had the opportunity to significantly improve my skills by adding and supporting various libraries, other frameworks, and clean code requirements to the project, all of which are essential for framework development.

My career began at Sakarya University, where I worked for more than 2.5 years in the IT department. There, we developed and marketed university management systems to numerous universities. During this time, I worked for 1.5 years on the maintenance and enhancement of a monolithic project with new features.(And worked on some other projects) Subsequently, Subsequently, I worked for about a year on the migration of this project to a microservices architecture.

Throughout my career, I have been working as a Full-Stack Developer with a primary focus on C#. That has given me the opportunity to professionally gain expertise in various frameworks and libraries, including C#, ASP.Net Core, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Blazor, Unity and a lot of frameworks and libraries.

I've been developing web applications and frameworks professionally for over 7 years.
